##Technologies Used##
I used Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery.

##Getting Started##
[Lets go to the game](http://www.meisam.org/projects/)
The game is about to find the mines. Each box you swap there will either be a number of mines around each box or either a mine. If there is no number it means that there is no mine around it.
You can put a flag anywhere you think there is a mine. If you swap all the boxes without swaping the any mine you will win.
 
##Unsolved Problems##
The only unsolved problem is that I need to work more on the expanding the boxes if there is no mine it expands without any errors. My plan for the future is to add the ability to choose between beginner, intermediate, and advanced and have an option for the user to choose the number of columns, rows and mines.
